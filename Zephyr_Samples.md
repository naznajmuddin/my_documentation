## Overview

This is how you can understand and develop something from scratch.

**How To: Learn Zephyr from Scratch**

Go to Zephyr Samples & Demos and find the feature that you want to apply on your code structure.

**Things to take note:**

1. Project Config (prj.conf)
2. DeviceTree configuration (.dtsi: io_master, peripherals)
3. Overlay configuration (.overlay)
4. Board Support Package configuration (exist in your development or not)
